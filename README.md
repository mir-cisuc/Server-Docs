# Server-Docs
A collection of documents to guide new users on how to properly use the shared server. [Wiki](https://github.com/mir-cisuc/server_docs/wiki)

When using the server, check the management [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHpLPIev_VlaQ02HDj4PxKb1wIAMegj_4uUFKsEzi0U/edit?usp=sharing) first and follow the "How to Use" to better organize our time and resources.
